# Hi, I'm Glara! ðŸ‘‹

Personally, my true calling is solving puzzles and problems that seem hard to solve. Frankly, I'm addicted to doing research and sharing it with others. **I see the beauty of doing research in the moments when you are confused and desperately looking for an answer to tackle a problem that has not been solved for a long time.** I'm addicted to the dopamine that solving the puzzle releases. Also, I love it when I share my thoughts with others, even those who are not experts in the area, and they bring up new questions and answers that make me think again. I enjoy this cycle, and I hope I can show you how stunning it is.

Professionally, I am a dedicated **computer architecture researcher** with a passion for designing **high-performance** and **energy-efficient systems**. My technical expertise lies in **hardware design**, **bio-inspired computing**, **parallel computing**, and **Approximate Computing**. As a member of the **ICVLSI research group**, my work focuses on **approximate computing**, **hardware accelerator**.

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to **education**. As a **teaching assistant**, I guide students through complex concepts, offer mentorship, and create resources that bridge the gap between **research** and **learning**. Iâ€™m passionate about making education more **accessible** and **engaging**, to build progressive community.


Through my [personal blog](https://gisink.com), I share insights on both **research** and **education**, hoping to inspire others and contribute to the future of innovation and learning.
